### First Time Visitor Goals

### Returning Visitor Goals

To easily locate where and how to contact the charity.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The 3 main colours are black, white and pink
Black and white are key contrasting colours which makes website content easy to read, the pink adds a fun, calming touch to compliment this.

An optional 4th colour would be a muted orange or green to create a full colour palette.

### Typography

The header font, Amatic SC, is a simple and effective hand-drawn font, which adds a playful touch. The paragraph font, Montserrat, is a classic and clean font which is easily readable to users. Sans-serif is the fallback font, in case of any import issues.

### Imagery

The 3 images used clearly give the user an expectation of what the charity is about. While no filters have been applied, the pictures chosen all have a similar feel and style to each other.
